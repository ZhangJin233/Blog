Hello, I'm Jane

and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my blog, a blog dedicated to all things software, testing, and the wonderful world of automation. Here, I'll be sharing insights and knowledge drawn from my own career experiences as a software engineer specializing in Test.

My passion lies in crafting robust test automation systems, and I have a knack for building them from the ground up. This journey involves not only developing the test code itself but also creating the infrastructure necessary for seamless integration into continuous development pipelines. Beyond test automation, I also dabble in web development and tool development when the opportunity arises.

<!-- One of my greatest joys in the tech world is delving into databases and compiler theory. The intricate dance between data storage and the science of compiling code has always fascinated me, and I find myself continuously drawn to exploring these realms. -->

My primary programming language of choice is Python, but my curiosity and adaptability have led me to work with a variety of other languages as well. I have a Computer Science BS/MS from Southwest University for Nationalities, and if you'd like to delve deeper into my professional background, you can find my full resume on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jin-zhang-48693023b/)**.

As I share my insights, experiences, and discoveries through this blog, my goal is to make Automation both a journal for my own professional growth and a valuable resource for fellow enthusiasts and professionals like you. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey through the world of software, testing, and automation.

Stay curious and keep automating!

Warm regards,
Jane
